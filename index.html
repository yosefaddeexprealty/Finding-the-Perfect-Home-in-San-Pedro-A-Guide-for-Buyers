                    <li>Make a Competitive Offer
                        <p>Depending on market conditions, you may need to act quickly when you find a home you love. Your real estate agent will help craft a strong offer based on comparable sales and the seller’s expectations.</p>

                    <li>Home Inspection and Closing Process
                        <p>A home inspection is essential to identify any potential issues before finalizing your purchase. Once everything is in order, you’ll proceed to closing, where final documents are signed, and ownership is transferred.</p>
